            Not long ago, a friend of ours intended that there is no good app for time tracking. That's the time when my boyfriend and I
            decided to develop one with all its necessary features.

            We did a lot of research, had a couple of ideas and finally get a first prototype. Friends and family should be our first test
            users, and soon we will launch the app officially

            We wanted a color that represents trust and trustworthy color, so we decided on a dark blue. There shouldn't be much color
            change, so the main color should be a dark blue. For contrast, I chose a lighter and warmer blue to convey safety, trust as well
            as confidence.

            As we wanted a modern sans-serif Font, we decide on Lato, designed in 2010 by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic. The semi-rounded details of the
            letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.
